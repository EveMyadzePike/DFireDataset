D-fire is an image dataset of fire and smoke occurrences designed for machine learning and object 
recognition algorithms with more than 14000 images in which techniques of data augmentation (Mirror and Noise) were applied resulting in more than 40000 images. In addition, all images were annotated to the YOLO format.
