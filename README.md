# D-Fire Dataset 

D-fire is a image dataset of fire and smoke occurrences designed for machine learning and object 
recognition algorithms with more than 20000 images in which techniques of data augmentantion
(Mirror and Noise) were applied. In addition, all images were annotated to the YOLO format.
